Bucket List

This builds on what we learned making the travel brochure app and the crime map app and combines them.

A user can create a destination for their bucketlist activities and it will be added dynamically with ajax. They can then add activites in the same way which will be geocoded and added as markers to the map in the background.

Uses cucumber testing for the ajax parts, rspec to test the rest.
